  finalText: "Now, we can write the tasks. Tasks are like parts, but includes the
    deadline, budget, a template of task and the maintainer.\n\nTo create for this
    part, enter into the part by double click. Then, choose the task, instead the
    part.\n\nAlso, let's make a final call what to do next. \n\nFinally ask user
    to save the scene. After saving the scene, ask them to enter more data. (Also
    give a feedback, a reward)\n\nMedet: I will come to it a bit later, after implementing
    the parts, levels and server sync."
